<div class="col1" id="probio"> <header><u>Ω3 and probiotics</u></header><p> <u>Ω3 and probiotics</u> are at the top of the pyramid as they are needed in smaller quantities but are also one of the most important link for a healthy diet.<br>
  <br> <u> Omega-3 fatty acids</u> are a type of unsaturated fatty acid that may reduce inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation in the body can damage your blood vessels and lead to heart disease and strokes.
   <br>
    Omega-3 fatty acids may benefit heart health by decreasing triglycerides.<br>
    <br><u>Probiotics</u> are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your dog but also for you, especially your digestive system. We usually think of these as germs that cause diseases. But your body is full of bacteria, both good and bad. Probiotics are often called "good" or "helpful" bacteria because they help keep your gut healthy. So don't be afraid to include in your dogs diet cottage cheese, yogurt, spirulina, kelp, bananas and even small quantities of garlic.

<div class="col3" id="meat"><header>eggs/meat/fat/bones</header><p>
    <br>meat, fat and bones are the largest portion of your dogs diet. Don't forget to include intestines as they hold the most important nutrients but don't over do it with the liver which has also some toxins so keep it at 5% of your dogs daily portion. 
    <br>MEAT is the best source of protein, include white and red meat in your dogs diet.
    <br>FAT is also essential and shouldn't be confused with saturated fat which occurs after heating or cooking which destroys all the value and becomes a byproduct to the body and suppresses the immune system.
    <br>you can also add peanut butter to your dogs diet which has good unsaturated fat.
    <br>
    <br>BONES have many nutrients in them and should also be included in your dogs diet. But beware, only raw bone is digestible by your dogs stomach 
    <br>Glucosamine and chondroitin is a natural compound found in cartilage — the tough tissue that cushions joints.
    <br>Dogs that eat raw bones can delay the effects of degeneration as the animal ages. For older dogs or if there is an injury or concern, the therapeutic value can slow the progression of the injury and expedite the healing process. Larger breeds of dogs are typically more prone to hip dysplasia.

Oral hygiene tips to keep healthy gum and having teeth on their place even at old age.<br>

*Frozen raw marrow bones.  The enzymes from the raw marrow help break down plaque and tartar naturally.  Frozen raw bones are much less likely to splinter or crack than cooked bones.  They last forever, and getting more chew action equals cleaner, healthier teeth, and a happier hound. They are inexpensive and accessible at natural pet food stores or local butchers.

    <header>more tips</header><p>
        All food must not be heated up. heating destroys important enzymes which could potentially trigger allergies and autoimmune diseases, it also kills all the  probiotic values. Coocked bones can not be digested, so keep it always raw or prefrozen.<br>
